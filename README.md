# Pied Piper ERP
Buyer – Enterprise Resource Planning System

## Description

This is an app that helps purchasing departments that are using ERP systems to get an overview/dashboard to facilitate purchasing operations. 

## What this App Fixes

Procurement departments have many moving parts across the supply-chain, and viewing data from various different sources can slow production and cause errors. This app will be able to hook into the ERP systems DB. This allows the purchaser to work off one dashboard to view and submit the information they need.

## How to use Pied Piper

From the landing page you can have a new buyer register, and current buyers can sign in with their name and buyer id. On clicking submit in the Employee Sign in modal the user will be redirected to the req. page.
